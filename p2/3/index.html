  <!-- hi!! thank you for reading my lil comments.

  I tried multiple color swaps - this is the only one I could kinda see working, but i think i need to close my eyes for a bit an see how i feel about it. i dont think i like it. but im worried the original is a huge eyesore. its really bright.

  also im struggling with 1440px exhibits page - i dont know how to separate the different exhibits elegantly. the text is so short so it looks weird under the image header. tried 0 margins on the images, also looked weird.
